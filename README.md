👋🏽 Hello dear reader! My nickname is [@**MLang137**](https://github.com/MLang137), which stands for 'Matt's Local area network gameplay'.

💭 My Latin motto is *Audire multa, loqui minus, cogitare profundissime*, meaning 'Do not speak unless you can improve the silence'.

👁️ I enjoy travelling by train, writing Python scripts and casual gaming ([OpenLoco](https://github.com/OpenLoco/OpenLoco), Minecraft, Mario Kart).

⌨️ At the moment, I am studying computer & embedded systems engineering.

🇳🇱 Also, I'm Dutch and not very talkative.
